# twitter-contest-bot
Will poll for Retweet Contests and retweet them. Inspired by http://www.hscott.net/twitter-contest-winning-as-a-service/

A more acceptable use of this kind of app may involve using to search for philanthropic causes requesting retweets, and retweet less often so as not to seem spammy.
